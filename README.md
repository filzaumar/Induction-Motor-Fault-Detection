# Three Phase Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor Fault Detection 

-Used starting example of MATLAB: https://www.mathworks.com/help/sps/ug/three-phase-asynchronous-machine-starting.html  -Electrical Fault ( Voltage Unbalance ) induced.  -Mechanical Faults ( Torque Overload and Torque Braking ) induced.
Dataset created for transient states.  -Split data for test and train, classified into 4 classes ( Healthy, Voltage unbalance, Torque overload, Torque breaking )  -Achieved 99% accuracy even at 50-50 split.    -Used a damper to make graphs clearer for presenting.
